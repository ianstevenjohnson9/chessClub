            <h3>Welcome to the Chess Club.</h3>
            <p>This is a webpage that will focus on learners and friendly games of chess, hopefully you will find
                this page helpful in getting you started on learning the wonderful game of chess.
            </p>
            <h4>My Journey</h4>
            <p>My dad taught me how to play chess when I was in middle school, I first saw the game of chess when I 
                even younger than that, but it wasn't until middle school when I was really interested.
            </p>
            <p>My middle school had a chess club where we used to go at dinner time and have a game.
            </p>
            <p>My teacher must of seen lack of interest from the students as she then created a league format 
                competition, which increase the interest of winning.
            </p>

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>Learning how to setup a chessboard correctly is obviously the first step.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img id="setup"src="chessSetup.png" alt="Picture of a Chessboard"/>
                </div>
                <p>This is a picture of the chessboard setup, and the way I remember is the king is on the 
                    opposite colour of itself. You could always just remember that the queen is on the same
                    coloured square. 
                </p>
                <p>Either way you can find your own method of remembering.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pieces">
                <h3>Chess pieces</h3>

                </div>
                <p>Chess pieces have different movements so lets take a look them.</p>
                <div class="piece">
                    <h4 id="pawn">Pawn</h4>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="pawn.png" alt="Pawn picture"/>
                        <img src="pawnMovement.png" alt="Pawn movement"/>
                        <img src="pawnCapture.png" alt="Pawn Capture Movement"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>This is the Pawn piece, this piece offers protection to the other valuable pieces
                        and also added benefit of a promotion if you can get it to the enemies backline.
                        Where it turns into a queen.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece">
                    <h4 id="rook">Rook</h4>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="rook.png" alt="Rook picture"/>
                        <img src="rookMovement.png" alt="Rook Movement"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>The Rook piece is a excellent way to trap the king with its linear movement.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece">
                    <h4 id="knight">Knight</h4>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="knight.png" alt="Knight picture"/>
                        <img src="knightMovement.png" alt="Knight movement"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>The knight moves in what my dad explained it to me as an L shape. When I first started
                        playing chess I didn't know what use a knight was, but after a few games I realised
                        the knight can be used against defensive players as after a few L's you could position 
                        yourself into dangerous positions without endangering your own position. Only problem is
                        your opposition also has two.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece">
                    <h4 id="bishop">Bishop</h4>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="bishop.png" alt="Bishop picture"/>
                        <img src="bishopMovement.png" alt="Bishop Movement"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>The Bishop moves in diagonal Movements, I believe the Knight and Bishop work well 
                        together as the you can use them without much disturbance to the Pawn line. If you 
                        want to maintain a good defensive stragety.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece">
                    <h4 id="queen">Queen</h4>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="queen.png" alt="Queen picture"/>
                        <img src="queenMovement.png" alt="Queen movement"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>The queen is the most versatile piece on the chessboard and it can move in any direction,
                        this enables it to be the best at protecting your king or attacking the opposition king.
                        Attacking the king with the queen is a risky strategy as you may lose your queen in 
                        the process. Normally to a knight in my experience. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece">
                    <h4 id="king">King</h4>
                    <div class="images">
                        <img src="king.png" alt="King picture"/>
                        <img src="kingMovement.png" alt="King movement"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>The king is the root objective of the game, and that objective is to capture the king.
                        whereas the queen can manouerve multiple squares in any direction, the king can only 
                        move one square at a time, so his protection needs to come from the only pieces.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="objective">
                <h3>The Objective of Chess</h3>
                <p>Now that you Know the pieces associated with the game of chess lets discuss the objective
                    of the game.
                </p>
                <p>The Objective of the game is to capture the king while protecting your own king.</p>
                <p>There are many different strageties for chess and I believe that the experience of 
                    playing numberous different people is the best way to gain strategies for yourself.
                </p>
                <p>You could also look online further for tips to improve your game, but every game is 
                    not the same, so learning to adapt to the opposition player quickly is the way to go.
                </p>
                <p>I am not a professional so my experience of playing is limited.</p>
