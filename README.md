# Create a Club Type website.

Codecademy give me a challenge of creating a club type website of my choosing and to make it responsive.

Using the flexbox to produce the responsive website.

## Chess club

So I was a keen learner of chess when I was younger and thought I would do my project around that subject.

My page will have sections:

* about
* learning

* contact

### About

This section will a description of the webpage and a brief story on my learning of chess.

### Learning

This will begin with a just the basic setting up a chessboard and each chess piece movement.

### Events

This section is where the friendly games of chess will be held and other potential events will be located.

### Contact

This section is where the parents or students can contact the club for information.
